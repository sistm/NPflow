# This is an update of the NPflow package  

## Test environments  
 * local R installation, R 4.3.2 on macOS 13.5.2
 * Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), macOS (12.7) and Windows (Server 2022 10.0), R devel and release (through GitHub Actions)

## R CMD check results  
0 error | 0 warning | 0 note

On some architectures, the large volume of compiled file may trigger a note.
These compiled functions are necessary to ensure reasonable computation time
for NPflow.
I fixed the other notes from the v0.13.4 submission

## Reverse dependencies 
This update does not introduce new notes, warnings or errors in the reverse 
dependent package bqror


Thanks, Boris Hejblum
